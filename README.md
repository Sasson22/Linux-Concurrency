Linux Concurrence named Little Collins

Addressing XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability.

Starting with a fix for JVM parser
Beyond JVM and SAX parser
Featuring Golang concurrence

By creating a stream-oriented XML 1.0 parser library, written in GoLan using Goland IDE that fills in the dependencies automatically

The problem is:
Mapping between XML elements and data structures is inherently flawed: an XML element is an order-dependent collection of anonymous values, while a data structure is an order-independent collection of named values.

Why Golang?

Golang is selected, Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs
that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction.Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a
dynamically typed, interpreted language.
